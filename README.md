## The Experiment

The experiment investigates the roles of the descriptive norm effect and the self-categorization theory. To do so, participants are presented a dilemma situation and then asked to make one of two decisions to solve the dilemma. Prior to making a decision, participants were informed about how other people decided. Half of the participants were informed about how people in their ingroup (people belonging to a group they identify with) decided while the other half was additionally provided with information on how their outgroup decided.
The question of interest is whether participants who have seen both ingroup and outgroup information are more likely to make the same decision as the majority of the ingroup (following the self-categorization theory) or if they are more likely to decide as the majority of their outgroup did (following the descriptive norm effect).
